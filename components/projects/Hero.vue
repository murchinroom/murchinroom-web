        murchinroom runs a number of projects prefixed with "mu".
        <br /> <br />
        The original idea of these "mu" projects is to develop fun apps
        about music. <wbr />
        But as time goes by, we decided to expand the scope of "mu" projects
        to include other art forms.
        <br /> <br />
        Now we officially explain "mu" as an abbreviation for
        <del>"murchinroom universe"</del>
        "machine & you", which indicates
        the projects are exploring the intersection of machine learning (or AI)
        and human creativity (and emotion).
